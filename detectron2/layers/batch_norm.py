    """
    BatchNorm2d where the batch statistics and the affine parameters are fixed.

    It contains non-trainable buffers called
    "weight" and "bias", "running_mean", "running_var",
    initialized to perform identity transformation.

    The pre-trained backbone models from Caffe2 only contain "weight" and "bias",
    which are computed from the original four parameters of BN.
    The affine transform `x * weight + bias` will perform the equivalent
    computation of `(x - mean) / std * scale + offset`.
    When loading a backbone model from Caffe2, "running_mean" and "running_var"
    will be left unchanged as identity transformation.

    Other pre-trained backbone models may contain all 4 parameters.

    The forward is implemented by `F.batch_norm(..., training=False)`.
